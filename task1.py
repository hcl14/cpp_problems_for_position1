# The problem is to count numbers from 1 to N and factorize each one. 
# It means, that numbers aren't supposed to be big and usage of some advanced prime factorization algorithms 
# like Pollardâ€™s Rho is not beneficial. Trial division is used here:

# function that factorizes one positive integer (size_t is unsigned type)
# result is written to std::vector container
 
import numpy as np

# we need an object array that contains lists of different length
divisors=np.empty((1,),dtype=object) #array of lists containing database of divisors for each number
# unfortunately, we lose numpy speedup this way, another memory-costy variant is to initialize big matrix Nx(N/2) and have zeros there


# function that factorizes one number by division and database search
def factorize_to_primes( number ):
    #add factorized number to the database
    
    # np.append(divisors,[], axis=0) # does not work
